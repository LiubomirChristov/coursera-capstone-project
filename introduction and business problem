Tim Petrov is a young and talented designer producing handmade shoes under his own brand “TP collection” in Russia. 
His collections are targeted at young professionals aged 25 – 35, both male and female. Business is going well and last year he opened shops at almost every big city in Russia with population over one million.
Now he is planning to open his first shop abroad in 2020 and must choose in which EU city it will be. He is very familiar with Russian business reality but has no firm understanding of market situations in these cities.  Tim Petrov connected with consultancy company “ABC Wise” to get help with identifying which city and location he should choose for the first shop and get the order of other preferable locations.

During discussion with “ABC Wise” specialists, main criteria for selecting the city were specified as follow:
-	City with high GDP: although “TP collection” is not Haute couture, handmade design shoes are not cheap
-	Big population:  city with the bigger population is expected to have more potential customers
-	High percentage of young professional: they are our most prospective target group
-	local purchasing power: the higher is better
-	number of tourists visiting the city: tourists are our second target group
-	visitor cross-border spending
-	Doing business ranking. 

After finishing with selection of the city, Tim would want to get recommendation regarding preferable neighborhoods according the following criteria:
-	shoe shops in the same area: The more is the better as the brand is new and yet unknown, so few customers will travel specially to visit the shop. More likely they will look to buy shoes from an area with a lot of other shoe shops.
-	concentration of different kind of venues preferred by young professional like: trending café, fashion restaurants, art-galleries
-	university campuses
-	tourist attractions
